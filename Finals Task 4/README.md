# Finals Lab Task 4: Using SELECT Statements
## Task Description:
This task involved working with a single database containing two tables: EmployeeSalaries and EmployeeData. I performed a series of SELECT statements to extract and manipulate employee information.

## Task Steps:
- Create a database named payroll, use payroll
- Copy and paste the initial query then perform the SELECT statements required for each problem.

# Problem 1:
Consider a table named EmployeeSalaries that stores information about the salaries of employees. The table has the following fields:

employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
employee_name VARCHAR(100),
department VARCHAR(50),
salary DECIMAL(10,2),
hire_date DATE
After inserting the given data in the EmployeeSalaries table, perform the following SELECT statements:

## Retrieve the employee_name and salary of employees and arrange from the highest salary to the lowest.

employee_id – INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
full_name – VARCHAR(100)
department – VARCHAR(50)
